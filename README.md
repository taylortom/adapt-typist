# adapt-typist

Basic Adapt framework plugin that uses [jquery.typist](https://github.com/albburtsev/jquery.typist) to animate a number of text items.

Supports the authoring tool.

**Important note**: still very rough, created as a display plugin for a presentation.

## Configuration

The following are set in `components.json`:

- **texts** (array): The list of text items to animate.
- **loop** (boolean): Whether the animation should loop once it reaches the end.
